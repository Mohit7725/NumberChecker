# NumberChecker
A simple web application that accepts a number as input and displays the following:

- A message if the input is a negative number.
- The next three even numbers if the input is even.
- The next three odd numbers if the input is odd.

This project uses **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap CSS** for styling.
